| `is_main`             | boolean           | Whether this vote is a main vote. We classify certain votes as main votes based on the text description in the voting records published by Parliament. For example, if Parliament has voted on amendments, only the vote on the text as a whole is classified as a main vote. Certain votes such as votes on the agenda are not classified as main votes. This is not an official classification by the European Parliament and there may be false negatives. |
